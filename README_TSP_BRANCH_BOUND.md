This code implements the 'TravellingSalesPerson' algorithm using the Branch and Bound approach.
Here is a sample of the input file:
5
0 0 0
0 1 14
0 2 4
0 3 10
0 4 20
1 0 14
1 1 0
1 2 7
1 3 8
1 4 7
2 0 4
2 1 5
2 2 0
2 3 7
2 4 16
3 0 11
3 1 7
3 2 9
3 3 0
3 4 2
4 0 18
4 1 7
4 2 17
4 3 4
4 4 0

The first line is the number of cities
The First column of the second line is the CITY-A and the second column is the CITY-B . 
The Third column is the distance between CITY-A and CITY-B

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The output will be of the form:
Number of cites , least distance covering all the cities and back to source , max distace , time taken in seconds
